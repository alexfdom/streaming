It noted that investigations have revealed that “loan apps are overly intrusive.”
NDPC is also seeking a ban or restriction on mobile numbers found to have been used by lenders to breach the privacy of their customers.

EFCC denies releasing list of ex-govs under investigation,"The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has disassociated itself from a circulating report in the media alleging the release of a list of 58 ex-governors, under investigation for corruption, to t...",5th May 2024,https://punchng.com/efcc-denies-releasing-list-of-ex-govs-under-investigation/,  Nathaniel Shaibu,"The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has disassociated itself from a circulating report in the media alleging the release of a list of 58 ex-governors, under investigation for corruption, to the tune of N2.18 trillion.
In a press statement on Sunday, the EFCC clarified that it has not issued any such list nor discussed the investigation of the former governors with any media outlet.
According to the statement signed by EFCC spokesperson, Dele Oyewale, the report titled ‘EFCC Releases Full List of 58 Ex-Governors that Embezzled N2.187 Trillion,’ was “a phantom report,” deemed “false and mischievous.”
“The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission,  EFCC, feels obliged to dissociate itself from a phantom report circulating in sections of the media, claiming it has released a full list of ex-governors being investigated for alleged corruption.  




“The report headlined ‘EFCC Releases  Full List of 58 Ex- Governors that Embezzled N2.187 Trillion,’ in one of the news outlets, is false and mischievous as the commission neither issued the said list nor entertained discussions on the investigation of ex-governors with any news medium.

“This invariably means that the so-called list is a disingenuous fabrication designed to achieve motives known only to the authors,” the statement read.
Oyewale urged the public to disregard the report and advised the media to verify information regarding ongoing investigations directly with the commission, to prevent the spread of false and inaccurate information.        
The EFCC had said it would consider the fresh petition it recently received over the alleged N70 billion corruption case of Minister of State for Defence, Bello Matawalle.
The EFCC’s acting Director of Public Affairs, Wilson Uwajuren, stated this while addressing protesters under the aegis of the APC Akida Forum who were at the commission’s headquarters in Abuja on Friday to demand the reopening of the pending case.
On May 18, 2023, the EFCC, through its Director, Media and Publicity Affairs, Osita Nwajah, had said it was probing corruption activities, award of phantom contracts, and diversion of over N70bn allegedly carried out by the minister during his tenure as Zamfara State governor between 2019 and 2023.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/18093007/EFCC-Operatives.jpg

The three-man panel of the court also asked the respondents, the Attorney General of the Federation, the Police Service Commission and the Nigerian Police Force, to carry out a comprehensive review of the entire Police Regulations to ensure that they accord with the demands of a modern society operating under the rule of law.
Justice Olubunmi Oyewole read the lead judgment which was unanimously adopted by the other members of the panel, Justice Bukola Banjoko and Justice Okon Abang.
The court gave the judgment in the suit filed by the appellants, the incorporated trustees of the Nigeria Bar Association, against the three respondents.  




The legal battle began on February 15, 2021, when the Nigerian Bar Association filed an originating summons challenging the discriminatory practices within the Nigerian Police Force.
After taking the arguments, Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court, Abuja delivered his judgment February 21, 2022, where he dismissed the appellant’s action for lacking in merit.

In the judgment, the Court of Appeal unanimously allowed the appeal, overturning the Federal High Court’s decision in favour of the NBA.
The court held that Regulations 126 and 127 of the Police Act “interfere with the privacy of the lives of female police officers and discriminate against them on the basis of their gender”.
Justice Oyewole said, “I do not agree with the learned trial Judge that the regulations in issue are necessary for morality and discipline in the Police Force as morality and discipline do not have gender bias.
“It is unthinkable that the Nigerian Police of this day and age operates on the principle that female officers need to be specially moderated and regulated while their male counterparts are free.

"We aren’t Igbo, Rivers Ikwerre people reply Ohanaeze","An Ikwerre socio-cultural group, the Iwhnurohna Progressive Organisation has faulted claims by the Ohaneze Ndigbo and its President, Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu, that Ikwerre is part of Igbo. The IPO sa...",5th May 2024,https://punchng.com/we-arent-igbo-rivers-clan-tells-ohanaeze/,  Dennis Naku,"An Ikwerre socio-cultural group, the Iwhnurohna Progressive Organisation has faulted claims by the Ohaneze Ndigbo and its President, Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu, that Ikwerre is part of Igbo.
The IPO said it was careless and insensitive for Iwuanyanwu to be associated with such a claim that the Ikwerre people in Rivers State were Igbo, describing it as false and unfounded.
The IPO President, Dr Okachikwu Dibia, stated this at a news briefing in Port Harcourt, Rivers State capital on Friday.
Recall that the President General of the Ohaneze Ndigbo, Chief Iwuanyanwu, at a media briefing in Port Harcourt a fortnight ago, said the Ikwerre people were Igbo, saying the position of the Ikwerre nation that they were not Igbo, was a lie.  




Iwuanyanwu said, “One major factor to know the ethnicity of a people is language. Everybody identified to be Igbo and called Igbo, they spoke Igbo. They could have had some little differences, but it doesn’t stop the truth.
“For example, the word first son, in Owerri and Umuahia, we call it “Okpara”, in Onitsha it’s called “Okpala”, and in Ikwerre it is called “Epara”.
“It’s not me or my parents who say that Ikwerre are Igbo. For the Ikwerre people to say that they are not Igbo, it is not correct because their language shows that they are Igbo.        
“For example, they answer ‘Amadi, Amaechi, Onyesoh or Nyesom’, these are pure Igbo names with definite meanings. Some of them here in Ikwerre say they are from Benin; there is nothing wrong with it.
“Someone can say I was originally an Igbo man, but now I have made up my mind to change to Benin. It’s normal and will be accepted. But for somebody to come and tell a blatant lie that an Ikwerre person is not an Igbo person, it can’t be possible, and it can’t be defended in any modern society, because your culture, habit and name; everything is Igbo,”  Related News  Crazy bill: Hospital founder cries out after getting N25m electricity bill in Rivers  South-South backs Lagos-Calabar costal highway  Political chess: Wike, Fubara resume Rivers supremacy battle   
While noting that he was raised in Rivers State, Iwuanyanwu, said, “In those days, we didn’t have such controversies whether Ikwerre was Igbo or not. The truth remains that Ikwerre is Igbo.”
He therefore urged the Ikwerre people in Rivers State to participate in the programmes and activities of the organisation (Ohaneze Ndigbo) so as to maximise the impact and serve the purpose for its establishment.
But Dibia said features of appearance or similarities in language should not be used to determine where a person comes from, saying the Ikwerre people will no longer tolerated such ‘hate-claim’.
He stated, “To us at IPO, Ikwerre is Igbo means that all the ancestral communities in Ikwerre originated from Igbo. This is not true and can never be true, hence our reply to him (Iwuanyanwu) and indeed Ohaneze.
“For the avoidance of doubt, the Ikwerre people are a distinct ethnic nation recognised in Nigeria and the United Nations. Ikwerre language is one of the recognised languages in Nigeria and the United Nations.      
“Whoever is in doubt can contact the appropriate government authorities in Nigeria and the UN. While Ikwerre is our political name, Iwhnurohna is our native name, and both refer to the same people: Ikwerre Ethnic Nationality.
“We live and own the Emohua, Ikwerre, Obio/Akpor and Port Harcourt City (in alphabetical order) local government areas in Rivers State, Niger Delta, South-South geo-political region of Nigeria”.
Citing the works of some renowned scholars like Prof. Otonti Nduka, Dibia used thematic headings of appearances, innate qualities and history to explain that the Ikwerre remained distinct from the Igbo despite similarities in their language.
He said: “Consequently, IPO’s reply to Iwuanyanwu is that language, name, dances, songs, dressing cannot be and should not be used as determinants of who Ikwerre is. IPO wishes to reply to Iwuanyanwu that who a man truly is, is more about his core innate character and behaviour than the physicals he sees.”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/05124228/Ohanaeze.jpeg
"BREAKING: SERAP sues 36 govs, Wike over N5.9tn, $4.6bn loans","The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project has filed a lawsuit against the governors of the 36 states of the Federation, and the Minister of the Federal Capital Territory, Nyesom Wike, over ...",5th May 2024,https://punchng.com/breaking-serap-sues-36-govs-wike-over-n5-9tn-4-6bn-loans/,  Ajisafe Olayiwola,"The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project has filed a lawsuit against the governors of the 36 states of the Federation, and the Minister of the Federal Capital Territory, Nyesom Wike, over their failure to account for, and publish the agreements of the N5.9 trillion and $4.6 billion loans obtained by their states and the FCT, respectively.
The suit, numbered FHC/ABJ/CS/592/2024 was filed on Friday on behalf of SERAP by its lawyers – Kolawole Oluwadare, Kehinde Oyewumi and Valentina Adegoke, at the Federal High Court, Abuja.
The statement, which was made available to PUNCH Online on Sunday, asked the court to “direct and compel the governors and Mr. Wike to account for N5.9trn and $4.6bn loans obtained by their states and the FCT and to publish copies of the loan agreements, location of projects executed with the loans.”
The suit is a sequel to SERAP’s demand which was addressed to the 37 respondents in a statement issued by the organisation’s Deputy Director, Kolawole Oluwadare on March 31, 2024.  




Kaduna State Governor, Uba Sani, had bemoaned the huge debt inherited from his predecessor, Nasir El-Rufai, on May 29, 2023.
Sani said the state is now left with few amounts, not enough to pay salary, adding that his administration inherited a total of $587m, N85bn and 115 contract liabilities from the ex-governor.
In the statement, SERAP urged the court to “direct and compel the governors and Mr. Wike to invite the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission and the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission to investigate the spending of all the loans obtained to date by their states and the FCT.”        
In the suit, SERAP is arguing that “it is in the public interest to grant the reliefs sought. Nigerians have the right to see and scrutinise the loan agreements and know the details of how the domestic and external loans obtained by the governors and FCT minister are spent.  Related News  No more political crisis in Rivers, says Fubara  Why Fubara can't be described as the political leader of Rivers - Senator Abe  Rivers politics: Wike, Magnus Abe settle longstanding rift   
“Opacity in the spending of the loans obtained by the governors and Mr. Wike would continue to have negative impacts on the fundamental interests of the citizens.”
The statement noted that many states, including the FCT, “reportedly” spend “public funds which may include the loans obtained by them to fund unnecessary travels, buy exotic and bulletproof cars and generally fund the lavish lifestyles of politicians,” adding that they are “allegedly mismanaging public funds which may include domestic and external loans obtained from bilateral and multilateral institutions and agencies.”
The organisation demanded transparency in the spending of the loans as they are “fundamental to increase accountability, prevent corruption, and build trust in democratic institutions with the ultimate aim of strengthening the rule of law.”
The statement equally noted that the state governors and the FCT minister “cannot hide under the excuse that the Freedom of Information Act is not applicable to their states and the FCT.”
It stated that the “legal obligations to publish the information sought are also imposed by the provisions of the Nigerian Constitution and the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights.”
While no date has been fixed for the hearing of the suit, SERAP lamented that the poverty rate, underdevelopment and lack of access to public goods and services in the country are a result of the “many years of allegations of corruption and mismanagement of public funds including the loans obtained by the states and FCT.”      
SERAP quoted the Debt Management Office, saying, “The total public domestic debt portfolio for the country’s 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory is N5.9 trillion. The total public external debt portfolio is $4.6 billion.”
However, SERAP said that the loans – domestic and external, as obtained by the states and the FCT are” vulnerable to corruption and mismanagement,” hence, the respondents “have a responsibility to ensure transparency and accountability in how any loans obtained by the states and FCT are spent, to reduce vulnerability to corruption and mismanagement.”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/29013144/govs.jpg

Police spokesperson in the state, SP Benjamin Hundeyin, confirmed the arrest in a post he shared on his X (formerly Twitter) handle @benHundeyin on Saturday.
He said that the suspects were arrested on Saturday by officers from Isokoko Division of the command.
“The suspected fraudsters were arrested by officers from Isokoko Division following a distress call.  




“They were found with two female handbags, cash and an iPhone,” he said.

"'I can't breathe,' says UK lawyer Dele Johnson pinned down by security for refusing to remove shoes","A duty solicitor recounted a harrowing experience where he was restrained by “four or five” court security staff, despite his plea that he couldn’t breathe. Defence solicitor Dele Jo...",5th May 2024,https://punchng.com/i-cant-breathe-says-uk-lawyer-dele-johnson-pinned-down-by-security-for-refusing-to-remove-shoes/,  Okiki Adeduyite,"A duty solicitor recounted a harrowing experience where he was restrained by “four or five” court security staff, despite his plea that he couldn’t breathe.
Defence solicitor Dele Johnson, speaking with The Law Society Gazette,  described how guards pinned him down with their knees after he refused a security search request to remove his shoes.
The incident took place as Johnson was fulfilling his duties in the Youth Court at Stratford Magistrates’ on Wednesday, May 1.
He told the Gazette he thought “for about 30 seconds that I was in danger.”  




Johnson, 37, drew a parallel between his experience and the tragic incident involving George Floyd, whose death at the hands of Minneapolis police ignited the Black Lives Matter movement.
“I never thought I’d also be saying ‘I can’t breathe’,’ said Mr Johnson. ‘I was just trying to do my job.”
The London Criminal Courts Solicitors’ Association has raised concerns, stating that lawyers may boycott the court if the guards allegedly involved in the assault on Johnson are not suspended by the private company OCS.        
Johnson’s identification card was checked upon his arrival as a duty youth court solicitor on Wednesday.
Following a brief exit from the building for a cigarette break, he consented to a pat-down search upon his return but refused to remove his shoes, leading to an altercation with four guards who forcibly removed him.
Despite having a defendant awaiting his representation, Johnson attempted to re-enter the building through a side door, only to be intercepted by “four or five” guards.
During the court proceedings, Johnson stated that security personnel had entered the courtroom. He had a feeling that this was probably related to him.
After the court proceedings, Johnson exited the courtroom and engaged in discussions with fellow representatives.
Upon his arrival, he was denied entry by the security personnel.
Johnson said, “One of the security officers blocked me while I tried to go to court number 10.”      
Johnson, who used the second door to attempt entry, added, “He pushed me and I said “What are you doing?”. I tried to go through the other door, and he pushed me and said “You’re not going in”. Then somebody grabbed me by the neck, another person grabbed my arm.”  Related News  I am still in UK, lady in viral video debunks report of relocating to Nigeria  Nigerian woman appointed Lord Mayor of Leeds  George Floyd killer, Derek Chauvin, stabbed 22 times in prison – Prosecutors   
Johnson said, at this point, “four or five” guards grabbed him.
He said, “I was saying “you need to let me go” but it got worse. I said, “If you do not let go of me, I will have to defend myself”. I started swinging. I felt like I was fighting for my life against five grown men to stop them from holding me and grabbing me.
“Eventually, they got me on the ground, and it hurt a little bit. There were quite a few grown men on my back. Their knees were on my arms, legs, and back.
“I have asthma, my chest was being pushed to the floor so now I am struggling to breathe.
“I never thought I would be the one saying “I cannot breathe”.
“I was just trying to do my job. It was my duty to be there.”  
According to Johnson, he couldn’t recall the exact moment when the security guards released him from the ground, but he did remember that the presence of the police at the court put an end to the situation.
The incident occurred two weeks after defence solicitor Katie McFadden disclosed on X.com that court security personnel in the Stratford Magistrate insisted on conducting invasive pat-down searches, including feeling under her dress.
McFadden tweeted that during one search earlier this year, security staff felt “my legs all of the way under my dress up to my groin.”
The controversy arises amid protests from female lawyers over highly invasive ‘pat-down’ searches at Stratford Magistrates’ Court in East London, Daily Mail reports.
A barrister, who requested anonymity, informed The Mail on Sunday that security personnel at the court exhibit behaviour akin to “nightclub bouncers”.
Another barrister remarked, “Some are thinking of a boycott here.”
Daily Mail reports that His Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals Service, an executive agency of the Ministry of Justice, has reacted to the situation.

Auwal reportedly wrote, “We are used to these frequent requests from people soliciting money to buy white cloths and clay pots. Some have requested vehicles for transporting the dead.”  




The senator, whose district covers 15 Local Government Areas, is an accountant who has been representing Kano Central since 2023, on the platform New Nigeria Peoples Party.
The Senator’s gesture is said to be in line with the traditional Muslim burial customs observed in the North.
White fabric is traditionally used to wrap the deceased, followed by broken clay pots as the initial covering before burial in sand.

Operation Rescue Naira: FG plans strict rules for $57bn crypto businesses,"The Federal Government may consider the suspension of the $56.7bn peer-to-peer cryptocurrency market after a crucial meeting between the Securities and Exchange Commission, and digital asset operators...",5th May 2024,https://punchng.com/operation-rescue-naira-fg-plans-strict-rules-for-57bn-crypto-business/," Justice Okamgba, Oluwakemi Abimbola","The Federal Government may consider the suspension of the $56.7bn peer-to-peer cryptocurrency market after a crucial meeting between the Securities and Exchange Commission, and digital asset operators scheduled for Monday.
Nigeria’s volume of crypto transactions grew by nine per cent year-over-year to $56.7bn between July 2022 and June 2023, according to the 2023 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report by Chainalysis, a United States of America-based international blockchain analysis firm.
The latest move by the SEC signals a broader effort by the Federal Government to tighten regulatory oversight within the cryptocurrency space amidst growing concerns over illicit activities and the manipulation of the naira exchange rate.
Earlier this week, the Central Bank of Nigeria had stopped major fintech firms from onboarding new customers in an ongoing audit of their Know-Your-Customer process. Following the regulatory action, major fintech firms, including Opay and PalmPay, sent emails to their customers on Friday, warning them against trading in cryptocurrency or any virtual currency on their apps, and threatened to block any accounts found engaging in such activities.  




The threat to block accounts has faced heavy criticism, particularly from the 33.4 million individuals actively trading cryptocurrencies; many of whom rely on cryptocurrency trading as their primary source of income.
However, Sunday PUNCH learnt that during the proposed Monday meeting, the government may choose to announce a temporary halt in the P2P crypto trading to enable it come up with a comprehensive set of rules for effective regulation of the space.
Other sources privy to the meeting said the government might choose to engage the crypto stakeholders on a new set of rules that could be deployed to better regulate the space.        
They ruled out the possibility of imposing a temporary halt on P2P crypto trading. As of Sunday, details of the exact decision the government might take during or after the meeting with the crypto operators remained sketchy.
However, operators in the crypto market confirmed the meeting, saying the meeting would bother on the current development in the space. The Blockchain Industry Coordinating Committee of Nigeria, in a notice posted on its X handle on Saturday, noted that the meeting had been at the instance of the new Director General of the SEC, Dr Emotimi Agama.
BICCoN said, “The newly appointed Director General of the Nigeria Securities and Exchange Commission has proposed an industry-wide meeting with the Nigeria blockchain community. The meeting will be facilitated by the Blockchain Industry Coordinating Committee of Nigeria.”
Officially, the SEC has yet to confirm the Monday meeting, but sources close to the commission confirmed the meeting on Saturday. They, however, said that ‘nothing was cast in stone yet’.
In 2021, the CBN had restricted banks and other financial institutions from operating accounts for cryptocurrency service providers. However, in December 2023, the financial regulator lifted the ban and announced a reversal of the policy.
Fresh concerns emerged in February over the activities of the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, Binance, on its peer-to-peer platform, such as implementing a price cap on USDT trading.
Authorities said those activities contributed to the devaluation of the naira and destabilised Nigeria’s economy.      
Worried over the significant volume of transactions through Binance Nigeria, the CBN Governor, Yemi Cardoso, stated that $26bn had passed through the platform over the past year from ‘unidentified sources’.
Amid the crackdown, the crypto exchange ceased all naira services, including deposits, withdrawals, and trading pairs, starting in early March 2024.
In an interview with Sunday PUNCH, the Chairman of BICCoN, Lucky Uwakwe, said that the group would be seeking to reach a middle ground with the regulator, which had so far this year introduced stiffer guidelines for digital asset operators, as well as a proposed increase in the registration fees.
Ukakwe said the meeting “is for us to try and bring the industry to be compliant and remove bad actors who abuse technology, especially the concern raised by the government on those that use the technology for market manipulation of naira.
“We also hope that innovation in the industry is encouraged to enable the industry to gain more foreign inflow that will aid the current administration’s drive for foreign investment into the nation as seen in other countries such as China and the UAE, and not to stifle the industry.”
On his part, the President of Stakeholders in Blockchain Technology Association of Nigeria, Obinna Iwuno, told one of our correspondents that there was no official communication on the ban of cryptocurrency transactions from regulators. He said, “There is a whole lot going on. It is not just clear the direction as we speak, but hopefully, on Monday, we will get to have a position, “What we have done to solidify our position with the Nigerian government is that local exchanges stopped their naira services. The government raised an alarm that cryptocurrency was responsible for naira depreciation; operators stopped,” Iwuno explained.
The ‘Know Your Customer’ compliance level of fintechs has also been a source of worry for regulators. This involves verifying a customer’s identity and understanding their financial activity to prevent financial crimes, such as money laundering, terrorist financing, and fraud. According to the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System’s fraud watch report, fraud losses increased by 496.96 per cent over the past five years, and financial institution customers had lost N59.33bn between 2019 and 2023.  
The report read in part, “The amount lost to fraud has increased over the past five years, along with the growth of financial transactions in the digital payments sector.”  Related News  Crypto: Peer-to-peer trading is worth $500bn in Nigeria - Cryptocurrency expert  Crypto transactions rise to $56.7bn as naira depreciates  Nigeria’s crypto transactions hit $56.7bn in one year — Report   
A source from one of the major fintechs in the country, who preferred anonymity, disclosed to Sunday PUNCH that the CBN was not declaring cryptocurrency illegal, but was rather focusing on addressing regulatory and identity management issues.
“Some of the expectations from the meeting would be to have a more robust and safer ecosystem that will prevent fraud, and protect the funds of customers.
“The CBN is not saying that cryptocurrency is illegal, but there have been issues surrounding regulations and identity management. Those are the grey areas that the CBN is trying to address. They don’t want a situation where people are getting into Nigerian systems to defraud others, or engage in any negative activity that could harm innocent Nigerians.
“It is more or less about finding a way to make this thing work better. Sometimes, people can simply create a virtual account, and one won’t even know who is behind the account. So, it’s really about ensuring end-to-end verification, from the first line of payment to the very end, with the account holders’ identities attached to it. I think it is necessary at this time,” the source explained.
Nigeria’s volume of crypto transactions grew by nine per cent year-over-year to $56.7bn between July 2022 and June 2023, according to the 2023 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report by Chainalysis. Despite Nigeria now leading in peer-to-peer exchange volume, sub-Saharan Africa accounted for only 2.3 per cent of the global cryptocurrency transaction volume between July 2022 and June 2023, making it the smallest crypto economy in the world.
In an interview with Techpoint Africa, Youssef said most of the P2P transactions did not happen on Binance or any other platform, but on social platforms such as WhatsApp, Telegram, and ‘everywhere on the streets’.      
“Most peer-to-peer (transactions) don’t happen on Binance P2P, NoOnes, or any of those other platforms. They happen on WhatsApp, Telegram, coffee shops, and everywhere on the streets. That is where most peer-to-peer is happening. I think most of that is peer-to-peer volume. They are trying to cover up too, because Nigerians are very crafty and have ways of using things for reasons other than what they were created for,” he maintained.
In March, the SEC, under the former DG, Lamido Yuguda, revealed plans to issue updated guidelines for the operations of digital assets and virtual asset service providers in the country, saying the new guidelines would ensure criminals did not gain entry into the country’s capital market.
The SEC notice, dated March 4, 2024, partly read, “The SEC has also developed a new AML/CFT/CPF onboarding manual for licensing, registration, and ongoing screening of digital and VASP beneficial owners to ensure that criminals are not registered as operators in the capital market. The SEC is ready to interface with genuine VASPs based on these clear rules and regulations.”
The SEC also proposed that for virtual (crypto) asset service providers, ‘no person or entity shall provide any virtual asset service unless registered with the Commission; a company seeking to operate as a VASP shall be incorporated and have an office in Nigeria. Its Chief Executive Officer/Managing Director or its equivalent shall be resident in Nigeria.”
When questioned about the SEC’s proposed guidelines in the crypto sector at the last Capital Market Committee meeting that he chaired, the former SEC DG said investor protection was a driving motive.
“We want to ensure that investors who decide to get involved in digital asset products are well protected. We want a platform where certain capital market functions are duly segregated. If you are an exchange, we don’t want you to also be a custodian, and such.
“Also, we are very mindful that AML/CFT considerations are very important when one is dealing with crypto assets. We want to make sure it is not money laundering or funds used to promote terrorist financing,” the former SEC DG said.        
The Chief Operating Officer of Fintech Association of Nigeria, Babatunde Obrimah, told Sunday PUNCH, “I am not privy to the circulars sent to the Fintechs, and I am not aware that crypto is illegal. The meeting will put things into perspective.”
“I think the issue is that to trade, one must be licensed by the SEC. So, if one is trading without a license, then one is technically illegal. But, we should talk after the Monday meeting, instead of speculating,” he added.
In March, the SEC proposed a 400 per cent increase in crypto firm registration fees. However, checks by Sunday PUNCH, on Saturday, showed that the proposed guidelines had been deleted from the SEC’s website. It is unclear when the PDF was removed from the regulator’s website.
The proposed amendments to the rules for crypto issuers, exchanges, and custody platforms include hikes to all supervision fees. Instead of a N100,000 application fee and a N30m registration fee, the SEC proposed N300,000 with every application, N1m as a processing fee, and N150m as registration fee, with the sponsored individual fees raised to N300,000 from N100,000.
An economist, Aliyu Ilias, emphasised the need for urgency in addressing the deficiencies within the fintech ecosystem, citing the ongoing struggle of the apex bank to effectively regulate them, as illustrated by the recent case involving Binance.
Ilias argued that in the dynamic tech industry, regulatory clampdowns often led companies to exploit loopholes, stating, “Even the Know Your Customer requirement proves insufficient.”
Another industry stakeholder, who is also the founder and coordinator of Blockchain Nigeria User Group, Chuta Chimezie, expressed hope that the Monday meeting would ‘help the industry significantly, and improve the relationship between regulators and policymakers’.      
“The last few months have been nothing short of wars. as the CBN keeps clamping down on P2P platforms,” he lamented.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/05010223/bitcoin-vs-naira.jpg

Marketers summon emergency meeting over fuel scarcity,"As fuel scarcity deepens across the country, marketers under the aegis of the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria have said their National Executive Council would be meeting officia...",5th May 2024,https://punchng.com/marketers-summon-emergency-meeting-over-fuel-scarcity/,IMOLEAYO OYEDEYI,"As fuel scarcity deepens across the country, marketers under the aegis of the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria have said their National Executive Council would be meeting officially on Monday to find a lasting solution to the problem.
Speaking exclusively with Sunday PUNCH on Saturday, the National President of IPMAN, Hammed Fashola, said that Monday’s meeting became expedient following the prevalence of fuel scarcity despite recent aggressive moves by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation.
Fashola told our correspondent that the NNPC, which is the sole importer of petroleum products in the country, opened up its reserves in all existing depots across the country on Friday in a bid to ease off the long queues at the fuel stations.
Even before then, the Major Energies Marketers Association of Nigeria had in a statement confirmed receiving 300 million litres of fuel from eight vessels during the week, which it said has been distributed to its members in Apapa and other locations in Lagos.  




Recall that the South-West Regional Coordinator of the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority, Ayo Cardoso, had also said that aside from the 240 million litres offloaded at various depots on Monday, close to 85 million litres of petrol was offloaded as of Tuesday evening.
But speaking to our correspondent on Saturday, Fashola said the Monday meeting is to assess how far the recent moves have gone in addressing the scarcity of petroleum products across the country and that the oil marketers would further engage the NNPC with outcomes of the meeting.
“We are meeting on Monday officially with other marketers. We are working closely with NNPC. The Monday meeting is for our National Executive Council. After the meeting, we will reach out to the NNPC. We talk with them every day,” he stated.          Related News  Fuel crisis, salary raise, UTME mass failure: Weekly news roundoff  NNPC, marketers in war of words over fuel scarcity  Fuel supply: 9,000 marketers may lose licences, seek FG’s intervention   
On the likely subject of the Monday meeting, he said, “It will be to assess the present situations. We evaluate what we have done so far. We will look at what is happening in the cities; assess the situations to know what to do again.”
“The meetings we have been having with the NNPC are in collaboration, which we have been doing. If you notice, yesterday (Friday), NNPC opened up their reserves in all the depots throughout the federation. And we are working with them to ensure that everywhere is wet so that this thing (scarcity) can disappear.
“I want to commend NNPC for their proactive measures. We are equally giving them the necessary support we are supposed to give them as oil marketers. I want to use this opportunity to appeal to members of the public to stop panic buying. They should buy what they need. Once they buy what they need, you will see that the long queues will disappear. So we are trying to discourage that (hoarding),” he stated.
Meanwhile, the Petroleum Products Retail Outlets Owners Association of Nigeria on Saturday held a meeting with other independent marketers in a bid to end the lingering fuel scarcity in the country.
Speaking with Sunday PUNCH, PETROAN, Dr Billy Gilly-Harry, said aside from developing new ways to prevent hoarding of petroleum products in the country, the meeting was held to also discuss how the products can directly get to Nigerians, including those in the rural areas at the given official rate.
“The meeting cut across all the associations. NNPCL has already called us and discussed it with us. We have had meetings with them. So last night’s meeting had nothing to do with NNPCL. It is about how to apply the solutions they have provided. And that is why you heard me talk very confidently that the solution (To the fuel scarcity) is in the corner,” he said.
“The good news is that this is a new reality. And it is going to bring better solutions because when you have NNPCL doing what they have to do, and we also doing what we have to do, the result will be fantastic. If you go to Abuja today, you will see that the queues have eased off. In the South-South and South-East, those who have been selling products as high as N670, we are bringing them to the book,” he added.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/01104705/Fuel-scarcity-in-Nigeria.jpeg

Idris gave the warning on Saturday during a visit to the inhabitants of Tudun Bichi in Wasagu Chiefdom of Danko-Wasagu Local Government Area.
The visit was to condole with them on the recurring attacks by bandits.
The governor, who was highly furious about the devilish act of informants, made it clear that he would append his signature to the death warrant of convicted informants.  




“The activities of informants defy all norms and religious doctrines. Just for a pittance, some miscreants will provide valuable information to bandits to perpetrate mayhem against their people.

“Let it be known to the informants that whoever is convicted for volunteering information to bandits leading to the killing of innocent souls, I will sign his death warrant instantly,” he warned.        
Idris gave an assurance that his administration would continue to provide the necessary support to the security agencies with emphasis on logistics, welfare of troops and other material requirements for combat readiness and operational successes.

Nigeria’s external debt servicing to reach $5.2bn in 2025 — Fitch,"The global credit ratings agency, Fitch, has projected Nigeria’s external debt servicing to rise by $400m to $5.2bn next year. This is despite insistence by the current administration to focus more ...",5th May 2024,https://punchng.com/nigerias-external-debt-servicing-to-reach-5-2bn-in-2025-fitch/,  Damilola Aina,"The global credit ratings agency, Fitch, has projected Nigeria’s external debt servicing to rise by $400m to $5.2bn next year.
This is despite insistence by the current administration to focus more on domestic borrowings from the capital market.
It also estimated that approximately 30 per cent of Nigeria’s external reserves are constituted by foreign exchange bank swaps.
This was disclosed in the latest credit outlook for the country.  




It revised Nigeria’s long-term credit default rating upward from stable to positive on the back of reforms in the foreign exchange market, oil industry and monetary policy over the past year.
On the external debt, the agency said external financing obligations through a combination of multilateral lending, syndicated loans, and potentially commercial borrowing will raise the servicing from $4.8bn in 2024 to $5.2bn in 2025.
The anticipated servicing includes $2.9bn of amortisations, including a $1.1bn Eurobond repayment due in November.        
The report read, “External debt service will rise in 2025. Government external debt service is moderate, expected at $4.8bn in 2024 and $5.2bn in 2025 (with $2.9bn of amortisations, including a $1.1bn Eurobond repayment due in November). The government plans to meet its external financing obligations through a combination of multilateral lending, syndicated loans, and potentially from commercial borrowing.”
This disclosure underscores the nation’s high debt service-to-revenue ratio posing significant fiscal constraints.
In 2023, the FGN’s external debt service payments increased by US$1.1bn to US$3.5bn in FY2023, comprising US$1.9bn and US$1.6bn in market and non-market debt payments, respectively.  Related News  Lagos records largest external debt in Nigeria – NBS  Debt rises by N20.8tn under Buhari, servicing gulps N10.26tn  Nigeria’s N24tn debt still sustainable, FG insists   
FG also projected a spending of N8.25tn to service its debt in 2024.
President Bola Tinubu stated that his administration is committed to stopping the vicious cycle of overreliance on borrowing for public spending and the resulting stress on the management of scarce government resources caused by debt service.
However, Fitch expressed uncertainties regarding the country’s net FX reserves, exacerbated by opaque entries amounting to nearly $32bn in FX forwards, over-the-counter futures, and currency swaps listed as off-balance sheet commitments in the Central Bank of Nigeria’s consolidated financial statement for 2022.
It noted that the lack of clarity over the precise size and composition of Nigeria’s FX reserves remains a significant constraint on the nation’s sovereign credit profile.      
It said, “Uncertainty continues over the net FX reserve position, with a particular lack of clarity on near USD32 billion of ‘FX forwards, OTC futures, and currency swaps’ recorded as an off-balance sheet “commitment” in CBN’s last consolidated financial statement for 2022.
“Fitch estimates around 30% of Nigeria’s reserves are made up of FX bank swaps, although we expect most of these to continue to be rolled over.”
Despite these concerns, Fitch anticipates that most of the FX bank swaps will continue to be rolled over, which could provide some temporary stability in the reserves management.
Further insights from the report indicate a recent upswing in non-resident inflows into Nigeria, driven by a greater formalisation of FX activities and tighter monetary policy measures.
Commenting, the Chief Executive Officer of the Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise, Dr Muda Yusuf, said the debt servicing was not expected to pose any major risk to the macroeconomic situation.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/15154232/Debt.jpg

The governor said that despite 80 per cent of the agreed contractual terms being paid, the contractor’s approach to the project has been unacceptable.
Governor Fubara made the disclosure when he visited the project site in Bori Town, headquarters of Khana Local Government Area of Rivers State on Saturday.
This was contained in a statement issued by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Nelson Chukwudi, and sent to newsmen.

“I don’t want to mention the name of the contractor, let it not be that I am being personal. But the contractor knows himself.
“He should better go back to the site or I will do something that will embarrass him as a person,” the governor warned.
The governor further explained that after payments were made, the contractor refused to move his men and equipment to the site, and even sacked his front desk officer for receiving a letter from the Ministry of Works demanding an update on the project.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/21215913/FUBARA.jpg

An Osun State High Court sitting in Osogbo, had on Friday restrained Adeleke from presenting Staff of the Office to Oba Oyelakin.
The restraining order dated May 3, followed a motion ex parte filed by Oba Raphael Oluponle in a suit numbered HOS/20/2024 through his counsel, Abdulrahman Okunade, where he sought an order of interlocutory restraining Adeleke from proceeding further to install Oba Oyelakin as Aree pending the hearing and determination of the substantive suit.

Alimi recalled that Osun State Executive Council presided over by Adeleke approved the appointment of the monarch on March 6, 2024, and the presentation of Staff of Office to him had been slated for Saturday.        
The commissioner subsequently urged the monarch and the people of Iree to remain calm and law-abiding in spite of the court decision.
He said, “Following an Osun State High Court’s Ex-Parte ruling Presided over by Hon Justice M.

“We want to state unequivocally that the status quo remains as the presentation of staff and instrument of appointment that would have been held today, 4th May 2024, is merely ceremonial and does not in any way invalidate the earlier approval granted Oba Oyelakin as the substantive Aree of Iree as approved by Governor Ademola Adeleke led Osun State Executive Council.”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/26004143/Osun-state-high-court.jpg

Others are Ebonyi, Lagos, Benue, Kogi, Ogun, Osun, Bauchi, Delta, Niger and Gombe states.        
Also included are: Edo, Kano, Yobe, Enugu, Sokoto, Bayelsa, Ondo states, and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja
Out of the amount, Delta State obtained the highest amount, N19.2bn, followed by Bayelsa State, N2.8bn then Cross Rivers State, N645.3m.
Between 2015 and 2017, Nigeria witnessed significant efforts to tackle ecological challenges through various projects.
However, several of the projects initiated by the Federal Government remain incomplete despite substantial investments.
Some notable examples of incomplete ecological projects across different states are: the stream erosion control located at Chief Ogungbo Road, Ago Iwoye, Ogun State, is at 42 per cent completion, while Ondo Township erosion control works, Ondo State, approved in November 2017, is at 30 per cent.
Gandu, Tukuntawa, and Zoo Road erosion and flood Control Project, Kano State and Tundun Magayaki/Cemetary/gully erosion and flood control, Sokoto South LGA, Sokoto State, are at 30 per cent.
Similarly, the shoreline protection project located at Alebiri, Bayelsa State, is at 45 per cent completion.      
 Mubi Flood/Erosion Control Works and River Yalzaram Training, which target flooding and erosion in Mubi, Adamawa State, are at 80 per cent completion.
The Erosion Control Works in Anambra State, which was approved in March 2017 and focuses on areas in Nda, Nnobi, and Agbor within Idemili LGA of the state, is at 70 per cent completed.  Related News   
Also, Adiabo Okutikang Beach Gully Erosion Control Works, aimed at addressing gully erosion near Adiabo Okutikang Beach in Cross River State, is at a 70 per cent completion stage.
Rice field erosion/flood control projects in Bagudu and Suru LGAs in Kebbi State and the flood and erosion control of Damaturu-Balmari-Gashua Road, Yobe State, have only seen 50 per cent of work done.
Only 45 per cent of works have been done at the mitigation of flooding into Uburu Salt Lake and Rice Farms in Ebonyi State.
The OORA/AAYO River erosion control and road improvement, located at Oke-Ayo Area, Ilesha, Osun State, is at 45 per cent completion.
Erosion control works, approved in June 2017, located at Makinde Way and Environs, Idimu, in Lagos State, is at 80 per cent completion.  
Tsoho Gwaram Erosion and Flood Control Project, which was approved in March 2017 and located in Gwaram LGA of Jigawa State and aimed to address erosion and flood issues in the region, is 85 per cent completed.
Erosion and flood control works in Tarka and Guma LGAs of Benue State are still at 88 per cent completion.
The Bauchi-Ningi Road Erosion Control, approved in October 2017, and the Burga-Gwammadaji flood and erosion control works are still at a 65 per cent level of completion.
The slow pace of these projects raises questions about accountability, transparency, and effective project management.
Citizens living in areas affected by erosion and flooding bear the brunt of incomplete infrastructure.
The acting Director-General of the FCT Emergency Management Department, Mr Mohammed Sabo, said the department was aware of the predictions, noting efforts to sensitise residents and barricade roads in flash flood areas in the city.
“We have the climate predictions for 2024 by the Meteorological Agency and the National Flood Outlook, and it has been predicted that there will be flash floods around FCT.      
“And the normal thing we do is that we engage in a lot of sensitisation of the general public, especially for those that are living within the river-bank areas, that they should immediately evacuate and go to higher ground, especially during the rainy season commences, to avoid being affected by the flood,” he stated.
According to Sabo, for most of these flash-flood areas, the agency barricades such areas whenever it rains.
Sabo further explained that the FEMD would begin stakeholder engagements in May, to review previous efforts, and draw up strategies to ensure the safety of lives and property in 2024 and carry out a fresh assessment of all flash-flood areas in the FCT.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/05020138/Ecological-Project-.png
"Minimum wage: ALGON criticises non-compliant LGs, calls for revenue sharing review",The Association of Local Governments of Nigeria has lamented that several local governments do not pay the national minimum wage agreed upon by the government and organised labour. The body warned def...,5th May 2024,https://punchng.com/minimum-wage-algon-criticises-non-compliant-lgs-calls-for-revenue-sharing-review/,"CHUKWUDI AKASIKE, GODFREY GEORGE AND DEBORAH TOLU-KOLAWOLE","The Association of Local Governments of Nigeria has lamented that several local governments do not pay the national minimum wage agreed upon by the government and organised labour.
The body warned defaulting LGs to desist from such acts and pay LG workers the agreed national wage.
ALGON President, Alhaji Maifata Mu’azu, claimed that, to date, some local governments still find it difficult to pay the former minimum wage of N18,000, which had since 2019 been changed to N30,000 by the Federal Government.
He warned that, once the new minimum wage regime begins after government approval, there should be no excuse by the LGs not to pay their workers the agreed wage.  




This comes at a time when the country is working on a new minimum wage for its workers.
Organised labour has insisted that the living wage should be N615,000 per month. The Federal Government is yet to agree to this, as the National Minimum Wage sub-committees are still consulting.
President Bola Tinubu had on Workers’ Day also promised, through the Minister of State, Labour, and Employment, Nkiruka Onyejeocha, a fair wage for the workers and added that the new minimum wage would take effect from May 1, 2024, irrespective of when the committee completes its job.        
In an interview with Sunday PUNCH, Mua’zu said, “If a new minimum wage is being declared, the third tier of government, which is the local government councils across the country will find it very difficult to pay.
“This is because, up to this time, many of these LGs are not paying the last minimum wage. That’s the one of N18,000. It is so because the allocation to the local government and the percentage from the federation account cannot sustain that.”
Speaking further, he said the Federal Government received over 50 per cent, followed by states and the LG is left with 20 per cent.
He added, “We are clamouring for an increase. We want them to take the local governments to about 22.5 per cent. If that is being reviewed to favour local governments, we are not saying it will be the same with the states or federal but just jack it up to about 22.5 per cent.
“If that is the situation, we can say the local governments across the country would be able to pay the minimum wage or the living wage as it is being called.
“Anything short of that is going to be very difficult. This is because most of the local governments – I can say – about 90 per cent of what they obtain from the federation account goes into paying salaries and pensions.”
       
‘Sharing formula faulty’
The ALGON president insisted that the sharing formula is faulty.
He said, “I can mention a few states that their state governors don’t even interfere. Still, it will be very difficult for them to pay their workers the agreed minimum wage. If a new minimum wage is being reviewed upward, there is no choice in the matter. It is a matter of fact. What I want us to address is the sharing formula.
“It is long overdue for a review. It is supposed to be reviewed after every five years or thereabouts. It has not been done. The revenue mobilisation has done its part and submitted the report or something for review to the presidency but it has not been attended to since the last regime.”
ALGON should raise the alarm – NULGE
The National President of the Nigeria Union of Local Government Employees, Olatunji Ambali, has faulted ALGON’s stance on the sharing formula, adding that the union could have raised the alarm long ago.
Ambali stated that whether or not the sharing formula was adjusted, ALGON would have no alternative but to comply with the new minimum wage.  
He said, “This is because we call it a National Minimum Wage, not a decentralised wage structure.
“I believe ALGON, too, wants their workers to survive and they want their workers to be the best, especially, when local government is the most strategic. They are confronted with poverty, insecurity, and joblessness, and it is the workers who are the engine room that drives development.  Related News  States should be allowed to determine minimum wage – Katsina gov  N615,000 pay: Govs demand sustainable minimum wage  Kogi workers demand N35,000 wage award payment   
“ALGON has not raised the alarm because it is a member of the Joint Account Allocation Committee, and as a statutory member of the committee, whatever happens, you have the right to debate at that level to discuss and agree. To NULGE, that is not a major concern, because we know once the negotiation has been concluded, it will also be easy for ALGON because they are involved in the negotiation.
“There is no benevolent employer of labour, everything we have got now is through negotiation and dialogue. We are conscious that even though they are raking in billions of dollars are not ready to pay their workers a living wage. So until labour is proactive to engage them and to put the facts and figures on the table and we can look at it critically then we will know. It is when we reach the bridge we will cross it.”
LG autonomy, only solution – TUC
Also speaking on the issue, the Deputy President of the Trade Union Congress, Dr Tommy Etim, stated that it was unfortunate that the country has a lot of policy somersault.
This is as he noted that the only solution to the issue of local government over-dependence on state governors would be solved by LG autonomy.      
He said, “A situation where the local government themselves don’t want to embrace local government autonomy and a situation whereby the state house of assembly doesn’t want to support the constitutional amendment making local government autonomy; what do we do? These are the major issues.
“Because, where you have a situation where allocation that’s supposed to go directly to the local government is being manipulated by what they call the Joint Account Charter Committee, that alone is frustrating. Don’t forget, there was a system in place where it was difficult for the local government to pay salaries.”
 
Wage increase by govs, not an excuse – Labour
Organised Labour has said the recent wage increment announced by some state governments is not a platform for them not to implement the new minimum wage when the act is implemented into law.
The National Vice-President of the Trade Union Congress, Tommy Etim, made this known in an interview with our correspondent in Abuja.
Certain state governors have started to announce salary increments for workers.        
For instance, the Ebonyi state government announced a salary increment of N10,000 for workers across boards in the state.
The Edo state governor, Godwin Obaseki also announced a new minimum wage of N70,000 in the state.
The Rivers state governor, Siminalayi Fubara, also announced that the state would implement the recent percentage increase announced by the Federal Government for civil servants in the state.
However, the national minimum wage committee popularly referred to as the Tripartite Committee on minimum wage set up by the Federal Government is yet to announce a new minimum wage.
The committee which was set up by the President Bola Tinubu-led Federal Government was expected to work towards the announcement of a new minimum wage on May 1, 2024.
Labour, comprising of the Nigeria Labour Congress and Trade Union Congress, has proposed a N615,000 minimum wage for workers.
Joe Ajaero, the NLC president in a statement said the figure was a product of a painstaking to protect workers in the country.      
“It was essentially an outcome of independent research conducted by the NLC and TUC on the cost of meeting the primary needs of an average family around the country.
“Our research was based on a family with both parents alive and four children without the burden of having other dependents with them.
“A questionnaire was designed and sent to all the State Councils of NLC and TUC from where these questionnaires were sent to our members in all the Local government areas in the country to gather the monthly cost of living for the average family as described above,” Ajaero explained.

The court found him guilty of diverting N112.1m from a customer’s fixed deposit funds for personal gain.
A statement by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission on Saturday indicated that Placidus was arraigned before Justice S. N. Odili of the Anambra State High Court on Tuesday, March 27, 2018.
He faced 16 charges, including forgery, stealing, obtaining by false pretence, and uttering.  




The case stemmed from a complaint by the bank, alleging that Placidus, while serving as the branch manager of FCMB in Onitsha, received the funds for a fixed deposit but failed to remit them as claimed.

Upon investigation, the EFCC discovered that Placidus diverted the money for personal use and provided a fake fixed deposit certificate to the bank. As a result, he has been sentenced and will serve time in a correctional centre.
“One of the counts read, “Nwachukwu Placidus between February 2009 and November 2014 in Onitsha, Anambra State within the jurisdiction of the Anambra State High Court of Nigeria with intent to defraud obtained the sum of (N112,100,000) One hundred and twelve million, one hundred thousand naira only, from Idemili Microfinance Bank under the false pretence that you have placed the said money in a fixed deposit account with First City Monument Bank PLC for it, which pretence you knew to be false and you thereby committed an offence”.        
He pleaded not guilty to the charges when they were read to him.
The statement further read, “In the course of trial, the EFCC, through its counsel, Mainforce Adaka Ekwu presented four witnesses and tendered several relevant documents which were admitted in evidence.
In the judgment, Justice Odili sentenced Placidus to nine years imprisonment on one count, four years on another, and nine years each on the remaining counts. He was acquitted on two counts, with the sentences to run concurrently.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/05010210/Nwachukwu-Placidus-e1714867329850.jpeg

Ogbodo told Sunday PUNCH on Friday that the delay was as a result of the enormous work needed to make the site ready to receive the expected IDPs.
His explanation came amid reluctance among Okuama people to yield to Governor Sheriff Oberevwori’s call on all residents displaced by the crisis to move into the camp for proper welfare as a first step towards the resettlement to their community where the military sacked them in the wake of the March 14 killing of 17 soldiers.
Ogbodo said, “The place was as if it never existed before. We are faced with dilapidated buildings, no roof, no windows, just nothing functional. So, repairing it for people to come in was bound to take some time.

Sunday PUNCH gathered that since Aiyedatiwa won the governorship primary of the All Progressives Congress held in Akure on Saturday, April 20, some chieftains of the ruling party have been lobbying to be his running mate for the upcoming election.
A chieftain of the party, who spoke with our correspondent under the condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to do so, disclosed that some loyalists of the governor in the Northern and Central Senatorial districts of the state do not want him to pick his incumbent deputy governor, Mr Olayide Adelami, as his running mate for the forthcoming governorship poll.
He said, “Many members close to Aiyedatiwa in the central senatorial district, particularly in Akure, are lobbying to be his running mate. There has been internal division on this matter in the camp of the governor over this issue.  




“Some from the Akoko area and Owo are desperately lobbying the national leadership of the party to prevail on Aiyedatiwa to make them his running mate.

Fasua said, “It is an issue to be trashed out, having weighed requisite political considerations. The governorship election is still seven months away and there is enough time to deliberate on the matter of a running mate.
